### Brazilian Data Mortality

Original source:
World Health Organization
International Statistic Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision
ICD10

Based on death certificate that captures more than 50 variables as:
* entity and municipality of registry,
* entity,
* municipality and locality of habitual residence; entity, municipality and locality of occurrence of death; sex, age, occupation, schooling, conjugal status, among others


### Project: questions to be answered

1. What is the science problem I need to solve?
2. What is the data that is available for this problem? Is it simple to get hold of this data? What is the volume of the data? Where is it? What is its format?
3. What do I think I will achieve by analyzing this data? What are the expected results?


### Introduction

Worldwide, the level of mortality during and after disasters is characterized to be gender-sensitive to the extent that roles and different responsibilities are associated with women and men in differential and unequal basis. In the case of Brazil, despite of well-known disparities between men and women due to socially constructed differences in attributes and opportunities, there are few information sources and knowledge about gender differential impact and their roles in disasters’ contexts. This research proposes to bring to light whether gender inequalities present themselves as conditions of differential impact and capacities to tackle disasters in Brazil.


### Research questions
Important scientific questions regarding disasters in Brazil still require answers: Are disasters gender sensitive in Brazil? Is loss of life due to disaster unequal between men and women?
